# 2025 and Beyond: Why Still Reinventing Frontend Frameworks?

In order to review and maintain AI-generated code before humans are completely out of the loop, we still need humans to do so. A well-designed frontend framework not only reduces the cognitive burden of humans but also improves the quality of AI-generated code. Let's take a look at how Axii is innovating in this era.

## Providing Elegant Abstractions for Common Scenarios

In frontend development, we often need to handle scenarios such as DOM state and selection logic. Axii provides multiple elegant abstractions by default:
### Responsive DOM State
Unlike traditional frameworks that require manual DOM event listening, Axii provides built-in responsive DOM state encapsulation:

- RxDOMSize      // element size
- RxDOMRect      // element position
- RxDOMDragPosition // drag position
- RxDOMScrollPosition // scroll position

### High-Performance Selection Management
Axii provides out-of-the-box single and multi-selection tools to ensure that only the necessary parts are updated when the selection state changes, while maintaining high performance.

## Innovative Component Reuse Scheme
One of the most exciting innovations of Axii is Component AOP technology. This technology completely changes the way components are reused:

```jsx
function App({}, { createElement }) {
    const name = atom('world')
    return (
        <Child
            // directly configure internal DOM styles
            $root:style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}
            // bind reactive data
            $main:value={name}
            // custom style merging logic
            $main:style_={() => ({ border: '1px solid black' })}
        />
    )
}
```

This approach brings several important advantages:

1. Component maintainers do not need to expose all possible configuration items in advance
2. Users can directly "penetrate" to customize internal elements
3. Perfectly supports importing styles from design tools while retaining dynamic capabilities

## Breakthrough Performance Optimization

Axii has made significant innovations in its responsive data structure. When dependencies change, it does not recalculate completely but automatically uses incremental calculation to update. This brings significant performance improvements in scenarios such as array operations.

## Future Rendering Technology

One of the important features of Axii is that it does not use Virtual DOM and does not require complex compilation tools. It implements responsiveness through the most direct way and is fully compatible with other DOM-based tools and standards. This design choice is based on profound insights into the future:
- Browsers are constantly providing better native abstractions
- Web standards are iterating quickly
- Many framework layer functions will eventually be replaced by native browser capabilities

## Summary

Today, Axii shows an innovative frontend framework. It not only provides elegant abstractions and excellent performance but also fully aligns with the future development trend. Whether used for manual coding or AI-assisted development, Axii can significantly improve development efficiency and code quality.
For developers who want to maintain technical leadership in 2025, Axii is definitely worth investing time in learning. It not only helps you write better code but also helps you better understand the future direction of frontend development.
